# Introduction
This repository is a collection of MATLAB scripts designed to simulate and analyze key concepts in signal processing and communication systems. Each script demonstrates a specific technique and provides visualizations (e.g., time-domain signals, frequency spectra) to help users understand the underlying principles.

## Scripts Overview
### 1. AM.m
- Simulates Amplitude Modulation (AM).
- Generates a modulated signal and plots the time-domain waveform.
- Use AMSpectrum.m to visualize the frequency spectrum of the AM signal.

### 2. DSBSC.m
- Simulates Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSBSC) modulation.
- Generates a DSBSC signal and plots the time-domain waveform.
- Use DSBSCSpectrum.m to visualize the frequency spectrum of the DSBSC signal.

### 3. FM.m
- Simulates Frequency Modulation (FM).
- Generates a modulated signal and plots the time-domain waveform.
- Use FMspectrum.m to visualize the frequency spectrum of the FM signal.

### 4. DeltaModulation.m
- Simulates Delta Modulation.
- Demonstrates the process of encoding and decoding a signal using delta modulation.
- Plots the original signal, quantized signal, and reconstructed signal.

### 5. Sampling.m
- Simulates the Sampling process.
- Demonstrates the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem by sampling a continuous signal.
- Use SamplingSpectrum.m to visualize the frequency spectrum of the sampled signal.
